                    <b>Machine learning Advances</b>
                    Machine learning grew out of part of artificial intellegence. Before this, many researchers were interested
                    of having machine learning data. By the time, the models and methods were different that statitics was found 
                    to bring a symbolic answer. Reasoning was employed in medical diagnosis and the emphasis on the logical 
                    data acquisition and representation. Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning were better employed with AI, 
                    making iductive logic programming. However, this affected the statical research of the AI field proper. 
                    By the time, machine learning was reorganized in a separate field in the 1990s. The field of machine leaning 
                    from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical changed its goal which its 
                    nature.This changed focused more in different approaches from AI and emphasized in methods and models borrowed
                    from probability theory which also brought benefits from the increasing to distribute information via Internet.
                    
                    Data mining work with the same methods,but machine learning use prediction, based on the properties learned
                    from the training given. Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but  data mining utilize
                    machine learning for different purposes. However,machine learning employs data mining for "unsupervised 
                    "unsupervised learning" and improve learner accuracy. Machine learning ties to optimization: 
                    many learning problems are formulated and thorught the training minimization becomes part of the loss of 
                    function which can bring discrepancy to the predictions. The difference between the two fields 
                    arises from the goal of generalization: while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a 
                    training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples.
