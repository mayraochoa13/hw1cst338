                    <b>Overview</b>
                    Throught the time, computer science field has grown. Machine learning as one of the methods that gives the ability 
                    to models to learn and adapt trhough experince. In 1959, an American pioneer in artificial intelligence, brought 
                    out the term of "Machine Learning". His name was  Arthur Samuel. Machine learning explores the study and construction
                    of algorithms that make prediction on data and data-driven decisions. Which mean that builds a model from different
                    sample inputs and predictates the functionality and effective predictions. It is employed in a range of computing
                    task where programming some explicit algorithms with a better perfomance including different detection of networks,
                    application and infiltrations towards a data breach opticalcharacter recognition (OCR), learning to rank, and 
                    computer vision.
