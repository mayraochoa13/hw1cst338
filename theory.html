                    <strong>Theory</strong>
                    Every learner has as objective to learn from different things such as experience in life, from school, parents, 
                    friends and situations around. Machine learning as a capacity to perfom accurately. Generalization is a term that
                    explains that a learner generalize from an experience. As mentioned  before, machine learning complete many task 
                    in accurency after machine learning seen deteminated data. 
                    The training consist on a generally probability distribution and the learner (machine learner) has to build a 
                    a model that will procuce different predictions of the case.

                    The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms go throught is called learning theory. Due to every
                    training is finite and the future is uncertain. In conclusion, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees
                    of the performance of algorithms, but in addition probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. 
                    That is why for the best perfomance the complexity of the hypothesis and function should match. So theorist 
                    found important to study the time complexityof learning. The term used is "polynomial time" where two kinds 
                    of results appear: Positive and Negative results.
